<h1>Hello! 👋 </h1>


- I’m @FedericoBonel a Tokyo based aspirant Software Engineer 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning software development and all that's included in that. Yes, I know, it's a lot, but I'm determined to overcome myself and I'm not afraid to fail, because:  <br> 
Failure -leads to-> Learning -leads to-> Gather skills and interiorize knowledge -leads to-> Become a better professional (and almost anything for that matter)  <br> 

- 🌱 I’m currently in college following a BSE in computer science and specializing in Software Engineering. <br> 
On the side, I'm learning a little bit about everything (i.e., artificial intelligence, front end and, back end frameworks, software architectures, emerging technologies, etc.) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really! I'm especially eager to learn more about tools, frameworks and technologies that would allow me to design better products.
- 📫 How to reach me? -> you can hit me up on bonelfederico@gmail.com

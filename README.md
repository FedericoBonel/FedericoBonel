<h1>Hello! 👋 </h1>


- I’m @FedericoBonel a Tokyo based aspirant Software Engineer 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning software development and all that's included in that. Yes I know, it's a lot, but I'm determined to overcome my self and I'm not afraid to fail, because:  <br> 
Failure -leads to-> Learning -leads to-> Gather skills and interiorize knowledge -leads to-> Become a better developer (and almost anything for that matter)  <br> 

- 🌱 I’m currently in college following a CE major and specialising in Software Engineering. <br> 
On the side I'm learning a little bit of everything (i. g. algorithm design and analysis, artificial intelligence, software architectures, front end, back end, new technologies and frameworks) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything as long as is fun and insteresting and it would lead me to grow. I'm specially eager to learn more about tools, frameworks and technologies that would allow me to design better products. I have to admit, I'm obsessed with good product design
- 📫 How to reach me -> you can hit me up on my email bonelfederico@gmail.com or on my twitter @bonelfede

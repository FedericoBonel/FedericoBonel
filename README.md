# Hello! 👋

- 👨‍💻 I’m @FedericoBonel, a Tokyo-based Software Engineer.
- 👀  I’m interested in learning software development and all that it encompasses. Yes, I know, it's a lot, but I'm determined to push my limits and I'm not afraid to fail, because:
Failure → Learning → Skills and knowledge → Better professional (and almost anything else for that matter)
- 📜 I just graduated from college with a BSE in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering.
On the side, I'm exploring a bit of everything (e.g., artificial intelligence, front-end and back-end frameworks, software architectures, emerging technologies, etc.) 
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I'm especially interested in web development and AI integration in web environments.
- 📫 How to reach me? -> you can hit me up on bonelfederico@gmail.com
